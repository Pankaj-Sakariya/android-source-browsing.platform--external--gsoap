2 sources of leaks were fixed as of 8/29/08

1) In some cases objects that are pointers to other objects and hich are themsleves contained in a vector would leak (the pointed object was lost). 
2) Objects that contained pointers where not deleted when the destructor was called

The file src\symbol2.c was fixed accordingly and therefore extreme care should be taken in upgrading or recompiling gSOAP (in other words make sure that this change is not lost)
